## Policy
An immutable set of qualifiers that an operators is attesting to.
Policies are created by developers that are integrating Aethos.
They are written in a human-readable format called Policy Expression Language (PEL) [link]
and are stored in the Aethos Service Manager[link].

## Middleware
Offchain infrastructure responsible for broadcasting transactions to operators and aggregating their signatures.
The middleware can soon be run by any individual or entity however, today it is run by Aethos labs.

## Operators
A network of nodes responsible for attesting transactions meet their destination protocol's policy.
Aethos Operators are run by individuals or entities that have been approved by the Aethos team and soon, the community.
Aethos is currently a permissioned proof-of-authority network as there are no slashing in place. This will change
as the network matures this year.

## Restakers
'Restaking' is made possible via Eigenlayer, where anyone can delegate their staked ETH to an operator in return
for a share of the operator's rewards, a method of passive income priced at the risk restaking with Aethos; currently zero.
As the network moves from proof-of-authority to proof-of-stake and slashing is introduced, both the risk and
yield generation will change.

## Actively Validated Service (AVS)
A term coined by the Layr Labs team, an Actively Validated Service is any system that requires its own distributed
validation semantics for verification,such as sidechains, data availability layers, new virtual machines,
keeper networks, oracle networks, bridges, threshold cryptography schemes, and trusted execution environments.
Aethos is a home-grown, actively validated service on Eigenlayer.
