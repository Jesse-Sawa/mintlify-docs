description: 'Integrate your protocol with Aethos'

## Conceptualize
You can think of Aethos as a notary service that can make attestations about anything on or offchain.
The attestations are specific to the destination protocols policy, you can consider a policy
as a set of qualifiers the operator is attesting to. These attestations are given to the client
before they are submitted onchain, where they are verified to belong to a registered notarizer (operator).

## Overview
Integrating Aethos requires you to make two major changes to your project, the first
on the smart contract level and the second is on your frontend client. The former
is to integrate the Aethos smart contracts and require signatures on the function-level.
The latter is to fetch these signatures from Aethos operators.

## Where your project fits in
// todo toggle between DEX, Bridge, ETC. contracts
// todo maybe show an animated video of how Aethos works
