## Aethos Service Manager
The backbone of the Aethos network, the Aethos Service Manager contract
is responsible for managing the network's operator and staker registry,
place where developers store their immutable policies and social graph
configurations, and also serving as a library for signature verification.

## Aethos Treasury
The Aethos treasury contract is responsible for accruing network fees
and distributing them to the network participants i.e. operators,
restkers, and information providers. The treasury contract is also responsible
for maintaining the network's reserve.
