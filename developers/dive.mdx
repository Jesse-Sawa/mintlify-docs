# Dive In
Today, Aethos supports AML policy using operator maintained, configurable, social graphs.
The policy you will specify will comprise of which social graph you want to use. Soon, anyone
will be able to deploy their own social graph, today we have three.

Aethos can be integrated into all parts of the stack, the following is the steps to integrate
Aethos into a EVM-based smart contract. Documentation for other use cases are coming soon.


## Integrate Aethos into your smart contracts

<Steps>
    <Step title="Download the Aethos contract library">
        ```bash
            npm install @aethos/v1/contracts
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Inherit the AethosClient by your protocol's smart contract">
        ```solidity
            import "@aethos/v1/contracts/AethosClient.sol";

            contract MyProtocol is AethosClient {
                constructor(address _aethosRegistry) AethosClient(_aethos) {
                    _setAethosRegistry(_aethosRegistry);
                }
                // Your protocol's code here
            }
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the AuthorizationParams as the last argument to your desired function and require authorization before any business logic">
        ```solidity
            function myFunction(uint256 _amount, AuthorizationParams memory _authParams) public {
                require(
                    authorizeTransaction(msg.data), "Transaction is not Authorized"
                )
            }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Integrate Aethos into your front-end
While we will release and SDK soon, this part is straightforward. You will need to make a ```POST``` request to
the Aethos API. We've excited to support both ethersjs and web3js transaction objects as well as raw transaction data.

The following are the steps to integrate Aethos into your front-end using ethersjs

<Steps>
    <Step title="Populate the transaction">
        ```js

        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Inherit the AethosClient by your protocol's smart contract">
        ```solidity
        import "@aethos/v1/contracts/AethosClient.sol";

        contract MyProtocol is AethosClient {
        constructor(address _aethosRegistry) AethosClient(_aethos) {
        _setAethosRegistry(_aethosRegistry);
    }
        // Your protocol's code here
    }
        ```

    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the AuthorizationParams as the last argument to your desired function and require authorization before any business logic">
        ```solidity
        function myFunction(uint256 _amount, AuthorizationParams memory _authParams) public {
        require(
            authorizeTransaction(msg.data), "Transaction is not Authorized"
        )
    }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
