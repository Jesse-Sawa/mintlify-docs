## Framing
You can think of Aethos as a notary service that can make attestations about anything on or offchain.
The attestations are specific to the destination protocols policy, you can consider a policy
as a set of qualifiers the operator is attesting to. These attestations are given to the client
before they are submitted onchain, where they are verified to belong to a registered notarizer (operator).

## What it Takes
Integrating Aethos requires you to make two major changes to your project, the first
on the smart contract level and the second is on your frontend client. The former
is to integrate the Aethos smart contracts and require signatures on the function-level.
The latter is to fetch these signatures from Aethos operators.

## How it Works in Your Project
Aethos supports pretransaction verificatio accross the blockchain stack and particularly on the application level.
This can be a cross-chain bridge, a DAO, a lending protocol, sequencer, or any other protocol or infrastructure qhich requires
the need for some pre-transaction rule or condition to be enforced and verified.
